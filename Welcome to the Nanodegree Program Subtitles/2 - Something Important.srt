0:00:00.380,0:00:02.029
If you followed the previous step,

0:00:02.029,0:00:06.700
you saw that text like this[br]can turn into text like this.

0:00:06.700,0:00:09.340
And even though you don't[br]know how this happened,

0:00:09.340,0:00:13.840
you probably can guess that these tags[br]here had something to do with it.

0:00:13.840,0:00:17.270
Somehow the computer was interpreting[br]those things differently

0:00:17.270,0:00:18.570
than how a person would.

0:00:18.570,0:00:20.910
And that is a huge idea.

0:00:20.910,0:00:23.590
Because before this experience[br]you probably didn't even

0:00:23.590,0:00:26.820
know what you didn't know[br]about making web pages.

0:00:26.820,0:00:30.630
And now, even though you don't really[br]know how to talk to a computer,

0:00:30.630,0:00:34.720
you may have some understanding of[br]what talking to a computer even means.

0:00:34.720,0:00:37.310
You're beginning to know,[br]what you don't know.

0:00:37.310,0:00:41.170
And may even have a basic intuition for[br]what coding even is.

0:00:41.170,0:00:44.220
Because coding a computer,[br]is just telling a computer

0:00:44.220,0:00:47.540
what you want it to do, by writing text,[br]in a way it can understand.
