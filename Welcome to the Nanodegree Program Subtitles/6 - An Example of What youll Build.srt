The skills and ways of thinking that we've been talking about  probably feel very vague right now.  But as you go through the Nanodegree,  you'll be working on a project which will make them much more concrete.  That project will be a web page, and  that web page will be a place to store your notes.  I've made a version here, and it's going to serve as both an example and  a reference for you to come back to.  This is my web page, and  by the end of this Nanodegree, you'll be able to build something just like it.  For now, let me just show you what's here.  You can see that there's these four sections,  Andy's Notes, Student Notes, Codepen Examples, and More Resources.  And these all correspond to these navigation items up here.  I can click on, let's say, Andy's Notes, and  it takes me to a new page with an entirely new URL, /nanodegree_notes.  And I can click on any of these links here to go to the corresponding section  of the page, and these links would take me even deeper.  You can see I 've also added my favorite videos from the course and  links to more resources.  I can also go to this section called Codepens, and  these Codepens are just little demos of what you can do with programing,  as well as the code to go along with it.  And in this whole page, there's quite a bit here.  But, for now, just focus on these couple sections.  In the very next lesson,  you'll learn how to make a page that looks like this one.  And I'm going to click Edit to view it in a bigger window.  I'm going to close these boxes since there's nothing in them.  And I'm going to make this a little bigger so I can see the code better.  So on the right, we see the page you'll be able to make.  Well, the page I made.  You'll make something similar.  And here we'll see the code that generated it.  And you should already recognize a little bit of it.  That, right there, is a b tag and a closing b tag.  And if you're looking at this code, you should feel free to mess around with it.  There's nothing you can do to cause any harm.  You can start deleting things,  and you'll see, oh, things are getting weird now.  I can delete more.  And, no matter how much I screw this up, it doesn't matter.  I can always refresh the page.  And it'll be right back the way it was.  If you want to take one of these and modify it yourself and  you have an account on CodePen,  you can click this Fork button to make your own version.  All right, so we're going to talk about this web page and  all the code that I used to generate it a lot more later.  But for now I just wanted you to know that this resource exists, and  you should use it in any way that's helpful for you.  The one last thing I want to show you is this Student Notes section  which currently only has this one submission, which is my own project.  A little meta, but that's all right.  At the end of this Nanodegree,  you're going to come here with your finished project and press this button.  If you want to share your project, you'll add your name,  a URL to your web page, a brief description,  a background image is optional, and a secret key, which your project reviewer  will give you when you've finally completed the Nanodegree.  You'll click this button, and your notes will be visible to the entire world but  most importantly to future students who go through this Nanodegree.  All right, that's enough talking.  You're probably ready to get started.  Good luck and have fun.
